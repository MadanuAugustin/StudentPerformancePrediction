# two configurations we need to setup when ever we are working with elastic bean stalk--
# elastic bean stalk is like a kind of instance which is provided to us to deploy our application

# And one of the extension is that .ebextensions that we created and it contains python.config file
# python.config file is mainly to tell the elastic bean stalk about what is the entry point of our application


# second-configuration
# WSGIPath : application : application -- we need to make sure that we give our application file name
